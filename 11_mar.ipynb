    "A z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large, typically more than 30. For example, a researcher wants to test whether the average height of all men in the United States is 70 inches. They take a random sample of 100 men and find that the average height is 71 inches with a standard deviation of 2 inches. Since the sample size is large, a z-test can be used to determine whether the difference between the sample mean and the population mean is statistically significant.\n",

They measure their cholesterol levels before and after the treatment and want to determine if there is a significant difference. Since the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown, a t-test can be used to make this determination."
